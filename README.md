2020 Update: 
This project is an example of how a person can have a clear vision of what they would like to create, but lack the ability to bring that vision to life. What I created was not what I intended to make. Ah well, live and learn, right!:)

Loop Dipole and the Chaoties
==========

Created by R. Bassett Jr.

Loop Dipole and the Chaoties is a 3D driving/flying puzzle game built in Blender Game Engine 2.69. Part racing game, part puzzle game, part shooter game, “Loop” is a single player experience designed to be rewarding, persistent, and just plain fun!



Project Scope & Gameplay
========================
This is a long term project to create a game that has the specific game play elements that I have in mind. In its finished form it will be single player, have persistent progress between play sessions, and generally be a “low stress” experience. The nature of the game play is to collect energy and use that energy to fight the bad guys (Chaoties) and balance the chaotic fountains of energy around the world (puzzles).

Character movement, specifically “going fast” with wacky physics, is a big part of the fun in the game. Just “driving” around the world doing nothing is an enjoyable experience. Managing your energy types, by way of looking for them, collecting them, storing them, and using them should allow for endless organic gameplay. Beating the game, by solving all of the fountain puzzles (in no particular order), is ultimately what happens in the end, but there’s no time limit or punishment for taking your time and enjoying the journey. In fact, the whole game is designed to just be enjoyed.


Documentation
=============
You will find all of the current documentation for the project, including an explination of how the project is organized, where it's been, where it's headed, and how to use it, in the /doc directory. I've also included old documentation and scripts in /doc/archive, in the off chance that they may prove useful to anyone studying the project, Blender, Python, or game development in general.


Art Style
=========
I am shooting for simple, clean, and fun. The world is made of wild energy constrained by coloured lines. The characters are beings of pure energy. Visually, the main character is made of anglular shapes and is of solid, reflective colors which change depending on the lighting. While this is simple to do in Blender, it also looks cool and easy on system resources (as far as I can tell).

The shapes that Loop takes on are that of sci-fi inspired vehicles. Planes, jets, and cars. He's a multifacited little guy! :)


Platforms
=========
Thanks to the Blender, the game will run on Linux, Windows, and MacOSX!


Timeline
========
This project will be completed some time before the heat death of our universe. Probably. I hope.
